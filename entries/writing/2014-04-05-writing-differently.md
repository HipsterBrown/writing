# Writing for the long haul

http://snarkmarket.com/2010/4890


* Find a small set of topics you're passionate about
* Write about them consistently
* Treat your body of work like a contiuous long-term project

The challenge is determining whether something you've written is meaningful enough to continue working on. These things often take time to gestate. Your mind needs time to process whether the thought was fleeting or if it has legs. Blogs/journals are great testbeds for this. Throw your ideas out there and let them marinate. Extract the good ideas from your "flow" and make it a part of your project(s).


* Information exchange in the online age
* Designing for fulfillment
* Iconography & Information design for the web
* Web performance
